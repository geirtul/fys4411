\subsection*{Results}
\subsubsection*{No interaction}
Only $\phi_0(r)$ occupied ($n_0 = 1$). Excellent agreement between $\phi_0(r)$
and HO ground-state function for all r. (Good check of method for noninteracting bosons.)
\subsubsection*{Interaction}
$E/N$ very sensitive to the few high-energy bosons at the edges of the trap.
These bosons increase the energy significantly, but change $\expect{r^2}$ little.
